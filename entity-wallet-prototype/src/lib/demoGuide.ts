/**
 * The guided demo: the whole story as a script the screen reads out to
 * whoever is driving.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The demo grew a story runner, flow jumps, a persona switcher, a state
 * switcher and a deployment switch, all in one panel — a toolbox for someone
 * who already knows the story, and a maze for anyone who doesn't. The written
 * guide didn't close the gap: it lives in another window, and reading it
 * while clicking is exactly what a presenter can't do. So the script moved
 * onto the screen. Each step says where you are, what is going on, what to
 * press, and — when it matters — a line worth saying out loud.
 *
 * HOW A STEP FOLLOWS YOU
 *
 * `match` is the screen a step happens on. Pressing Next takes you to the
 * next step's screen, as the right person. Doing the step yourself also
 * works: when a click in the product lands on the *next* step's screen, the
 * guide moves on by itself. Only the next step is watched, so wandering off to
 * another page never skips the guide ahead.
 *
 * Button names in `doThis` are bolded with **…** and must match the product
 * exactly — the guide is only as good as its agreement with the screen.

/**
 * WHY THE GUIDE STOPS WHEN PELDEN'S FIRST COLLEAGUE JOINS
 *
 * The prototype is scoped to onboarding: NDI's root administrator, the
 * platform admins root invites, a new company getting an Entity Wallet, and
 * the people that company brings on. The guide used to run on for six more
 * chapters — Bank of Bhutan's wallet, appointing a controller, presenting,
 * authority in a phone, revocation, appeals — which walk flows the catalogue
 * has not designed yet, and made a forty-step demo of an onboarding review.
 * Those screens still exist; the guide no longer walks them.
 *
 * Appointing a controller and a delegate follow it, because being invited
 * is only half of getting ready: a member can see the organisation, and
 * somebody still has to be able to act for it. Both are invited first and
 * appointed second, in that order and never the other way round, and both
 * prove who they are at the appointment rather than at the invitation
 * (FLOW-ONB-02 §7.3). Giving a member authority follows FLOW-DEL-01 and
 * SCR-DEL-02 to 05; the delegate's role is Flow 8, which is not designed yet,
 * so its chapter follows Story B5 and says on screen that it is ahead of spec.
 *
 * Member onboarding is here because the first day is now genuinely empty.
 * When it still listed the seed's colleagues, the room's first question on
 * seeing them was "how did these people get here?" — and the answer, an
 * invitation Dorji sends and they accept, is an onboarding in its own right.

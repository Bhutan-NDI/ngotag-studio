/**
 * SCR-ORG-07 — Organisation verified. FLOW-ORG-01 step 12.
 *
 * NOTHING TO ACCEPT
 *
 * The registration is accepted into the organisation's wallet automatically
 * at step 10 — agent to agent, scoped to the offer from the designated
 * authority. This screen used to ask the person to "accept the
 * registration": a user action the specification never had, and one that
 * made the most important credential in the chain look optional. It now
 * shows what the organisation already holds.
 *
 * THE NEXT CREDENTIAL, NOT THE NEXT ADMINISTRATIVE TASK
 *
 * The primary action is the next link in the chain — for a company, its
 * tax identity, which is applied for with this registration (UXD-14). It is
 * what shows the wallet works. Inviting colleagues and appointing someone
 * are administration offered before the organisation has done anything
 * with what it just received, and the largest group of users is the
 * proprietor who *is* the representative. Requesting a credential is
 * FLOW-CRD-01, not built here; the button says so rather than leading
 * nowhere silently.
 *
 * WHAT IT CAN DO, AND WHAT IT CAN'T
 *
 * "Verified" alone reads as "approved for everything". So the summary
 * carries the negative clause (UXD-04): it can hold and present
 * credentials; it can't issue them or verify anyone else's.
 *
 * NOT YET ACCEPTED
 *
 * Verified is not the same as usable. Until the representative accepts
 * responsibility (SCR-DEL-01, FLOW-DEL-02) the screen names the organisation
 * as verified and offers one thing — accepting — and nothing else that
 * could be used. A decline is stated without reading as a penalty, with the
 * way back offered and, for the other case, the authority named as the
 * place to change who the representative is (DEL-02/E2).
 *
 * GIVING OTHERS AUTHORITY, ONLY WHERE IT MEANS SOMETHING
 *
 * Giving someone authority to act and seeing who can act are secondary,
 * and only for an organisation that is not a sole proprietorship (UXD-24):
 * a proprietor delegating to themselves is not a task. "Ask NDI" to verify
 * or issue (FLOW-ACC-02) waits for Flow 4.
 *
 * NAME DIFFERS
 *
 * The organisation takes the name the authority returned. Where that
 * differs from the name the person knew it by — the invitation's, or the
 * organisation's name on the platform — the difference is stated rather
 * than substituted silently.

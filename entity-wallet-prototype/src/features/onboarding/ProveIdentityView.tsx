/**
 * SCR-ORG-03 — Check your NDI wallet. FLOW-ORG-01 steps 5–6.
 *
 * THE AUTHORITY ASKS, AND IS NAMED
 *
 * The identity request is raised by the authority, not by NDI (S2), and
 * this screen names it in the same words the wallet prompt will: "The
 * Corporate Regulatory Authority is asking who you are." If the page said
 * NDI and the phone said the CRA, people would learn that mismatched
 * prompts are normal — the habit phishing relies on (UC-09). The copy used
 * to say the wallet "tells us who you are" and that the citizenship number
 * went "to the platform"; neither was true. NDI keeps nothing from this
 * proof — the authority checks it against its own records.
 *
 * ONLY IDENTITY, AND SAID SO
 *
 * What is shared is listed, and so is what is not: nothing about the
 * organisation leaves the wallet, because the wallet holds nothing about it.
 *
 * EVERY WAY IT CAN END
 *
 * Declined and expired (E4) say nothing was set up. A rejected identity
 * credential (E5) sends the person to their wallet, not to NDI support. No
 * wallet at all (E11) is an honest dead end. On a phone (same device) the
 * code becomes a link to open the wallet.
 *
 * WHERE PROXY SIGN-UP IS CAUGHT
 *
 * Sign-up cannot tell a director from their accountant typing (UXD-09).
 * If the wallet that answers belongs to someone other than the account
 * holder, it stops here, with the proof in hand and before the authority
 * is asked anything. Walkable, because "what if someone else signed up for
 * them?" is the question the room asks.

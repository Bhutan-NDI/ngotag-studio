/**
 * Members of the organisation — FLOW-ONB-02's Kind M home, and the entry to
 * SCR-INV-01 and SCR-INV-03.
 *
 * TWO COLUMNS THAT MUST NEVER BE READ AS ONE
 *
 * "Role" is membership: who can sign in and see the organisation. "Authority
 * to act" is controllership: who may bind it, granted separately and
 * accepted (Flow 3). Membership is routinely mistaken for authority — the
 * reason FLOW-ONB-02 Q4 and UXD-04 exist — so they sit side by side and a
 * member with no authority says so in words, rather than leaving an empty
 * cell for someone to read as "not relevant".
 *
 * Identity is a third, separate fact. A person who joined by invitation has
 * not been checked against the register — anchoring happens when someone
 * takes on accountability, not when they join (Flow 1 design D3) — and act 2
 * will refuse to grant them authority until it has.
